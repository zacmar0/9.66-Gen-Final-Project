# # Tutorial: Reversible-Jump MCMC in Gen _(with applications to Program Synthesis)_

# ### What is this notebook about?
#
# In earlier tutorials, we saw how to write custom Metropolis-Hastings proposals and stitch them together to craft our own MCMC algorithms. Recall that to write a custom MH proposal, it was necessary to define a generative function that accepted as an argument the previous trace, and proposed a new trace *by "acting out" the model*, that is, by sampling new proposed values of random choices _at the same addresses used by the model_.
#
# For example, a random walk proposal for the addresses `:x` and `:y` might have looked like this:
#
# ```julia
# @gen function random_walk_proposal(previous_trace)
#     x ~ normal(previous_trace[:x], 0.1)
#     y ~ normal(previous_trace[:y], 0.2)
# end
# ```
#
# This pattern implies a severe restriction on the kinds of proposals we can write: the new `x` and `y` values must be sampled directly from a Ggen distribution (e.g., `normal`). For example, it is impossible to use this pattern to define a proposal that deterministcally *swaps* the current `x` and `y` values.
#
# In this notebook, you'll learn a more flexible approach to defining custom MH proposals. The technique is widely applicable, but is particularly well-suited to models with discrete and continuous parameters, where the discrete parameters determine _which_ continuous parameters exist.
#
# The polynomial curve-fitting demo we saw in the last problem set is one simple example: the discrete parameter `degree` determines which coefficient parameters exist. This situation is also common in program synthesis: discrete variables determine a program's structure, but the values inside the program may be continuous.

# ## 1. Recap of the piecewise-constant function model  <a name="piecewise-constant"></a>
#
# In [the intro to modeling tutorial](Introduction%20to%20Modeling%20in%20Gen.ipynb), you worked with a model of _piecewise constant_ functions, with unknown changepoints. Here, we model the same scenario, but somewhat differently.
#
# Given a dataset of `xs`, our model will randomly divide the range `(xmin, xmax)` 
# into a random number of segments.
#
# It does this by sampling a number of segments (`:segment_count`), then
# sampling a vector of _proportions_ from a Dirichlet distribution
# (`:fractions`). The vector is guaranteed to sum to 1: if there are, say, three
# segments, this vector might be `[0.3, 0.5, 0.2]`. The length of each segment
# is the fraction of the interval assigned to it, times the length of the entire
# interval (e.g., the third segment above would be length `0.2 * (xmax - xmin)`). 
# For each segment, we generate a `y` value from a normal distribution.
# Finally, we sample the `y` values near the piecewise constant function
# described by the segments.
#
# ### Using `@dist` to define new distributions for convenience 
# To sample the number of segments, we need a distribution with support only on
# the positive integers. We create one using the [`@dist` DSL](https://www.gen.dev/docs/dev/ref/distributions/#dist_dsl-1):

# A distribution that is guaranteed to be 1 or higher.
@dist poisson_plus_one(rate) = poisson(rate) + 1;

# Distributions declared with `@dist` can be used to make random choices inside
# of Gen models, just like native Gen distributions like `poisson` or
# `bernoulli`. Behind the scenes, `@dist` has analyzed the code and figured out
# how to evaluate the `logpdf`, or log density, of our newly defined
# distribution. So we can ask, e.g., what the density of `poisson_plus_one(1)`
# is at the point `3`:
#
#

logpdf(poisson_plus_one, 3, 1)

# Note that this is the same as the logpdf of `poisson(1)` at the point `2` —
# `@dist`'s main job is to automate the logic of converting the above call into
# this one:

logpdf(poisson, 2, 1)

# ### Writing the model

# We can now write the model itself. It is relatively straightforward, though there 
# are a few things you may not have seen before:
#
# * *List comprehensions* allow you to create a list without writing an entire
#   for loop. For example, `[{(:segments, i)} ~ normal(0, 1) for i=1:segment_count]`
#   creates a list of elements, one for each `i` in the range `[1, ..., segment_count]`, 
#   each of which is generated using the expression `{(:segments, i)} ~ normal(0, 1)`.
#
# * The [Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) is
#   a distribution over the *simplex* of vectors whose elements sum to 1. We use it to
#   generate the fractions of the entire interval (x_min, x_max) that each segment of our
#   piecewise function covers.
#   
# * The logic to generate the `y` points is as follows: we compute the cumulative
#   fractions `cumfracs = cumsum(fractions)`, such that `xmin + (xmax - xmin) * cumfracs[j]` is
#   the x-value of the right endpoint of the `j`th segment.  Then we sample at each
#   address `(:y, i)` a normal whose mean is the y-value of the segment that
#   contains `xs[i]`.

@gen function piecewise_constant(xs::Vector{Float64})
    # Generate a number of segments (at least 1)
    segment_count ~ poisson_plus_one(1)
    
    # To determine changepoints, draw a vector on the simplex from a Dirichlet
    # distribution. This gives us the proportions of the entire interval that
    # each segment takes up. (The entire interval is determined by the minimum
    # and maximum x values.)
    fractions ~ dirichlet([1.0 for i=1:segment_count])
    
    # Generate values for each segment
    segments = [{(:segments, i)} ~ normal(0, 1) for i=1:segment_count]
    
    # Determine a global noise level
    noise ~ gamma(1, 1)
    
    # Generate the y points for the input x points
    xmin, xmax = extrema(xs)
    cumfracs = cumsum(fractions)
    # Correct numeric issue: `cumfracs[end]` might be 0.999999
    @assert cumfracs[end] ≈ 1.0
    cumfracs[end] = 1.0

    inds = [findfirst(frac -> frac >= (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin),
                      cumfracs) for x in xs]
    segment_values = segments[inds]
    for (i, val) in enumerate(segment_values)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(val, noise)

# And now the MH algorithm itself.
#
# We'll use a basic Block Resimulation sampler, which cycles through the
# following blocks of variables:
# * Block 1: `:segment_count` and `:fractions`. Resampling these tries proposing
#   a completely new division of the interval into pieces. However, it reuses
#   the `(:segments, i)` values wherever possible; that is, if we currently have
#   three segments and `:segment_count` is proposed to change to 5, only two new
#   segment values will be sampled.
#
# * Block 2: `:fractions`. This proposal tries leaving the number of segments
#   the same, but resamples their relative lengths.
#
# * Block 3: `:noise`. This proposal adjusts the global noise parameter.
#
# * Blocks 4 and up: `(:segments, i)`. Tries separately proposing new values for
#   each segment (and accepts or rejects each proposal independently).

# Our algorithm makes quick work of the simple dataset:

visualize_mh_alg(xs_dense, ys_simple, simple_update, 100, 1)

# On the medium dataset, it does an OK job with less computation than we used in
# importance sampling:

visualize_mh_alg(xs_dense, ys_medium, simple_update, 50, 10)

# But on the complex dataset, it is still unreliable:

visualize_mh_alg(xs_dense, ys_complex, simple_update, 50, 10)

#
# ### Exercise

# One problem with the simple block resimulation algorithm is that the proposals
# for `(:segments, i)` are totally uninformed by the data. In this problem,
# you'll write a custom proposal (using the techniques we covered in
# Problem Set 1B) that uses the data to propose good values of `y` for each segment.
#
# Write a generative function `segments_proposal` that can serve as a smart
# proposal distribution for this problem. It should:
#
# * Propose a new `:segment_count` from `poisson_plus_one(1)` (the prior).
# * Propose a new `:fractions` from `dirichlet([1.0 for i=1:segment_count])`
#   (the prior).
# * In each segment, propose the function value `(:segments, i)` to be (a noisy
#   version of) the average of the `y` values in our dataset from the given
#   segment. Draw `(:segments, i)` from a normal distribution with that mean,
#   and a small standard deviation (e.g. 0.3).
#
# We will use this proposal to replace the "Block 1" move from our previous
# algorithm. This should make it easier to have proposals accepted, because
# whenever we propose a new segmentation of the interval, we propose it with
# reasonable `y` values attached.

# We have provided some starter code:

@gen function segments_proposal(t, xs, ys)
    xmin, xmax = minimum(xs), maximum(xs)
    x_range = xmax - xmin
    
    # Propose segment_count and fractions
    # <edit the next two lines>
    segment_count = nothing
    fractions = nothing
    
    for i=1:segment_count
        # Propose (:segments, i) from a normal distribution
        # <your code here; and edit the next line>
        {(:segments, i)} ~ normal(nothing, nothing)
    end
end;

# We define `custom_update` to use `segments_proposal` in place of the first
# block from `simple_update`.

function custom_update(tr, xs, ys)
    (tr, _) = mh(tr, segments_proposal, (xs, ys))
    (tr, _) = mh(tr, select(:fractions))
    (tr, _) = mh(tr, select(:noise))
    for i=1:(tr[:segment_count])
        (tr, _) = mh(tr, select((:segments, i)))
    end
    tr
end;

# Let's see how this one does on each dataset:

visualize_mh_alg(xs_dense, ys_medium, custom_update, 50, 10)

visualize_mh_alg(xs_dense, ys_complex, custom_update, 50, 10)

# This will often outperform the simplest MH solution, but still leaves
# something to be desired. The smart `segment_proposal` helps find good function
# values for each segment, but doesn't help us in cases where the segment
# proportions are wrong; in these cases, the model just decides that noise must
# be high.

# ## 3. Involution MH for Split-Merge proposals <a name="split-merge" />

# How might we improve on the MH algorithms from the previous section, to more
# effectively search for good values of the `fractions` variable?
#
# One approach is to add new proposals to the mix that _iteratively refine_ the
# `fractions`, rather than relying on blind resimulation. A natural strategy
# might be to add _split_ and _merge_ proposals:
#
# * A _split_ chooses a segment to break into two pieces at a random point (and
#   chooses new values for the two segments).
# * A _merge_ chooses two adjacent segments to merge together into one segment
#   (with a shared value).
#
#
# ### MCMC, Metropolis-Hastings, and Reversibility
# Note that alone, neither of these two proposals makes for a valid
# Metropolis-Hastings transition proposal. Why? One requirement of MCMC
# algorithms is that each transition kernel (kernel, not proposal: **in MH, the
# kernel includes the accept-reject step**) _leave the posterior distribution
# stationary_. What does this mean? Suppose we somehow obtained an oracle that
# let us sample a trace from the exact posterior, $t \sim p(t \mid
# \text{observations})$. Then if we run an MCMC transition kernel $T$ on the
# trace to obtain a new trace $t' \sim T(t' \leftarrow t)$, the marginal
# distribution of $t'$ should still be the posterior. In simpler terms, no one
# should be able to tell the difference between "traces sampled from the
# posterior" (i.e., using the output of the oracle directly) and "traces sampled
# from the posterior then sent through a transition kernel" (i.e., passing the
# output of the oracle as the input to the transition kernel and using the
# result). As a formula,
#
# $$\int p(t \mid \text{observations}) \, T(t' \leftarrow t) \, \mathrm{d}t =
# p(t' \mid \text{observations})$$
#
# This is the stationarity requirement. Now suppose we set our transition kernel
# $T$ to a Metropolis-Hastings `split` move. The `split` move _always_ increases
# the number of segments. So if `t` comes from the true posterior, then the
# distribution of `t'`, in terms of number of segments, will necessarily be
# shifted upward (unless MH deterministically _rejects_ every proposal -- which
# is what MH in Gen will do if given a `split` proposal). The same issue exists,
# in reverse, for the `merge` proposal.
#
# In general, this "stationarity" rule means that our Metropolis-Hastings
# proposals must be *reversible*, meaning that if there is some probability that
# a proposal can take you from one region of the state space to another, it must
# also have some probability of sending you back from the new region to the old
# region. If this criterion is satisfied, then the MH accept-reject step can
# accept and reject proposals with the proper probabilities to ensure that the
# stationarity property described above holds.
#
# To make "split" and "merge" fulfill this "reversibility" criterion, we can
# think of them as a constituting a *single* proposal, which *randomly chooses*
# whether to split or merge at each iteration. This is an example of a
# _reversible-jump_ proposal [1].

#
# ### Implementing Split-Merge in Gen
# This is a sensible proposal. But if we try to write this proposal in Gen, we
# quickly hit several roadblocks. For example:
#
# * The proposal needs to make several random choices that are *not* meant to
#   serve as proposals for corresponding random choices in the model. For
#   example, the proposal must decide whether to "split" or "merge," and then it
#   needs to decide _at which index_ it will split or merge. But Gen interprets
#   every traced random choice made by a proposal as corresponding to some
#   choice in the model.
# * Once we choose to split (or merge), it's unclear how we should propose to
#   the various relevant addresses: from what distribution should the proposal
#   sample `fractions`, for example? What we need is to propose a
#   _deterministic_ value for `fractions`, _based on_ the random choices the
#   proposal makes.
#
# To get around these issues, Gen provides a variant of Metropolis-Hastings that
# is a bit trickier to use but is ultimately more flexible.
#

# The idea is this: first, we write a generative function that samples all the randomness
# the proposal will require. In our case, this will involve
#
# * choosing whether to split or merge
# * choosing at what index the split or merge will happen
# * if splitting, choosing where in a segment to split
# * choosing new values for merged segments or newly created split segments

@gen function split_merge_proposal_randomness(t)
    old_n = t[:segment_count]
    
    # Choose whether to split (T) or to merge (F), keeping in mind
    # that if old_n == 1, then our decision is made for us
    # (split).
    if ({:split_or_merge} ~ bernoulli(old_n == 1 ? 1 : 0.3))
        
        # split
        # What index to split at?
        index ~ uniform_discrete(1,old_n)
        # Where is the splitting point, relative to the segment being split?
        split_percentage ~ uniform(0, 1)
        # New values for the two new segments
        new_value_1 ~ normal(t[(:segments, index)], 0.1)
        new_value_2 ~ normal(t[(:segments, index)], 0.1)
    else
        # merge
        # What index to merge at? (Merge index i and i + 1)
        index ~ uniform_discrete(1, old_n-1) # merge i and i+1
        
        # Sample a new value for the merged segment, near the mean of the
        # two existing segments' values.
        new_value ~ normal((t[(:segments, index)] + t[(:segments, index+1)]) / 2.0, 0.1)
    end
end;

# Let's look at what this function samples:

tr, = generate(piecewise_constant, (xs_dense,), make_constraints(ys_complex,));
get_choices(simulate(split_merge_proposal_randomness, (tr,)))

# We now need to write an ordinary Julia function that tells Gen how to use the
# proposal _randomness_ generated by the generative function above to create a
# proposed next trace for Metropolis-Hastings.

# The function takes four **inputs**:
#
# * The previous trace, `t`
# * The proposal randomness generated by our generative function above,
#   `forward_choices`
# * The return value, `forward_retval`, of the generative function we defined --
#   we won't use this for now
# * `proposal_args`: the arguments, other than `t`, that were used to generate
#   `forward_choices` from the generative function written above. In our case,
#   that function has no additional arguments, so this will always be empty.

# It is supposed to return three **outputs**:
#
# * `new_trace`: an updated trace to propose. We can construct this however we
#   want based on `t` and `forward_choices`.
# * `backward_choices`: a choicemap for the `proposal_randomness` generative
#   function, capable of "sending `new_trace` back to the old trace `t`". For
#   example, if we are enacting a `split` proposal, this would specify the
#   precise `merge` proposal necessary to undo the split. This serves as "proof"
#   that our proposal really is reversible.
# * `weight`: usually, `get_score(new_trace) - get_score(t)`. The reason we need
#   to return this is that it is possible to write proposals that need to return
#   something different here; if your proposal involves deterministically
#   transforming continuous random variables in non-volume-preserving ways, see
#   the Gen documentation for details on how `weight` should change. In this
#   notebook, `weight` will always be `get_score(new_trace) - get_score(t)`.

# We call the Julia function an *involution*, because it must have the following
# property. Suppose we had an old trace `old_trace`, and we propose a new trace
# using `proposal_randomness_func` and then our Julia function `f`:
#
# ```
# forward_choices = get_choices(simulate(proposal_randomness_func, (old_trace,)))
# new_trace, backward_choices, = f(old_trace, forward_choices, ...)
# ```
#
# Now suppose we use `backward_choices` and ask what `f` would do to
# `new_trace`:
#
# ```
# back_to_the_first_trace_maybe, backward_backward_choices, = f(new_trace, backward_choices, ...)
# ```
#
# Then we require that `backward_backward_choices == forward_choices`, and that
# `back_to_the_first_trace_maybe == old_trace`.

# Here's an involution for Split-Merge:

function involution(t, forward_choices, forward_retval, proposal_args)
    # Goal: based on `forward_choices`, return a new trace
    # and the `backward_choices` required to reverse this
    # proposal.
    new_trace_choices = choicemap()
    backward_choices  = choicemap()
    
    # First, check whether we're dealing with a split or a merge.
    split_or_merge = forward_choices[:split_or_merge]
    
    # To reverse a split, use a merge (and vice versa)
    backward_choices[:split_or_merge] = !split_or_merge
        
    # Where is the split / merge occurring?
    # Reversing the proposal would use the same index.

end;

# Look at the last two lines of the involution. The involution is responsible
# for returning a *new trace*, not just a new *choicemap*. So, the common
# pattern to follow in involutions is:
#
# * Throughout the involution, fill a choicemap (here, `new_trace_choices`) with
#   the updates that you want to make to the old trace `t`.
# * At the end, call Gen's `update` function, passing in (1) the old trace `t`,
#   (2) the model function's arguments, (3) a tuple of "argdiffs" (in our case,
#   we know that the argument `xs` has not changed, so we pass in `NoChange()`),
#   and (4) the choicemap of updates. `update` returns two useful values: the
#   new trace, and a `weight`, which is equal to `get_score(t') - get_score(t)`.
#   This is the weight we need to return from the involution.

# ## Exercise

# Here are some possible "improvements" to the above split-merge proposal, which
# may sound reasonable, but which are all in fact _invalid_. For each, state why
# it is invalid, and briefly describe a version of the suggested improvement
# that _would_ be valid.
#
# 1. Proposed improvement: 
#    make the `split` smarter, by always setting `split_proportion` to split
#    somewhere between points `i` and `i+1`, where `i` and `i+1` are the two
#    adjacent datapoints that have the largest $|y_i - y_{i+1}|$ value. The
#    precise split proportion can still be random, drawn so that the split
#    occurs uniformly between $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
#
# 2. Proposed improvement:
#    when choosing an index to split or merge, make smart choices: when
#    splitting, choose the segment that currently explains its data least well
#    (according to the likelihood of the `y` points that fall on the segment),
#    and when merging, choose the two adjacent segments whose existing values
#    are closest to one another.
#    
# 3. Proposed improvement:
#    when splitting, do not sample `:new_value_1` and `:new_value_2` randomly;
#    instead, in the involution, set them equal to the mean values of the
#    datapoints that fall within their segment intervals.
#    
#

# ----
# <!-- # BEGIN ANSWER KEY 2.10
#
# "Improvement" 1: 
# Why it's invalid: Not reversible: when we merge two datapoints, 
# in order to re-split them, we may need the freedom of being able 
# to split anywhere, not just within a promising interval.
#
# Alternative approach: Make the split location random, but centered
# around the midpoint of the x_i -> x_{i+1} interval.
#
# "Improvement" 2: 
# Why it's invalid: Not reversible; indeed, the split proposal will almost
# never choose to split something that the merge proposal would have chosen
# to have merged!
#
# Alternative approach: Like in 1, these choices can also be made random--we
# can use a "softmax" instead of a "max." But there will still be a problem:
# the proposal would be technically reversible, but the acceptance rate would
# still be very low, because smart splits are very unlikely to be reversed
# by smart merges and vice versa. To mitigate this, we can use a "Smart Split-Dumb Merge,
# Smart Merge-Dumb Split" pair of proposals.
#
#
# "Improvement" 3: 
# Why it's invalid: Not reversible: an arbitrary merge cannot be reversed by this split.
#
# Alternative approach: Add some amount of noise to :new_value_1 and :new_value_2.

# ## 4. Bayesian synthesis of Gaussian Process kernel programs  <a name="synthesis"></a>

# We now consider a more complex model, adapted from the [Bayesian synthesis paper](https://popl19.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2019-Research-Papers/79/Bayesian-Synthesis-of-Probabilistic-Programs-for-Automatic-Data-Modeling) by Saad et al.
#
# Our goal is to analyze time-series data: for some sequence of times $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n$, we have observed points $x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots, x(t_n)$. We'll model a time series as arising from a Gaussian process with a particular _covariance kernel_. A covariance kernel is a function that takes in two times $t_1$ and $t_2$, and
# computes a covariance between the random variables $x(t_1)$ and $x(t_2)$. Different covariance kernels can encode various structured patterns in the data. For example:
#
# * A _squared exponential_ kernel assigns high covariance to pairs of time points that are nearby, and lower covariance to pairs of time points that are far away.  This kernel encodes a _smoothness_ prior: the time series does not change drastically from one moment to the next.
#
# * A _periodic_ kernel assigns a covariance that depends on $\sin(f \cdot \lvert t_1 - t_2 \rvert)$ for some frequency $f$. This allows it to assign high covariance to points that lie the "right" distance from one another, but not too near or too far, encoding a periodic structure: the time series is highly correlated with itself, some time earlier.
#
# * A _constant_ kernel encodes some constant covariance between $x(t_1)$ and $x(t_2)$, no matter what $t_1$ and $t_2$ are.
#
# These primitive kernels can be composed in various ways, e.g., addition and multiplication, to encode more complex features of time series.
#
# The main inference task we address in this section will be to infer a covariance kernel that captures the structure of a time series. In particular, given a dataset of $t_i$, $x(t_i)$ pairs, we would like to infer a covariance kernel `k` that makes the dataset likely under $GP(k)$, a Gaussian process with $k$ as a covariance kernel.
#
# Covariance kernels will be represented by _expressions_ in a simple domain-specific language (DSL). The simplest of these expressions are primitive kernels, each of which comes with one or more parameters:
#
# * `Constant(param :: Float64)`
# * `Linear(param :: Float64)`
# * `SquaredExponential(length_scale :: Float64)`
# * `Periodic(scale :: Float64, period :: Float64)`
#
# Smaller expressions can be combined into larger ones using _binary operations_ for addition and multiplication:
#
# * `Plus(left, right)`
# * `Times(left, right)`
#
# Here, `left` and `right` are _other_ covariance kernel expressions.
#
# An expression, like `Plus(Constant(0.3), Periodic(3.2, 1.9))`, can be viewed as a _syntax tree_.
#
# Primitives form the leaf nodes of the tree; binary operations form the internal nodes, each of which has a `left` and `right` subtree. The code below defines this tree datatype for representing expressions, which we call `Kernel`.

# ### A prior over kernel programs

# Our goal will be to infer a covariance kernel program that explains our time series.
# To do this, we begin by placing a prior over covariance kernels. The main ingredient
# will be the following distribution over Kernel Types:

kernel_types = [Constant, Linear, SquaredExponential, Periodic, Plus, Times]
@dist choose_kernel_type() = kernel_types[categorical([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1])];

# It is essentially a categorical distribution, but one that outputs kernel types
# instead of integers.
#
# We then write a prior over kernels that uses `choose_kernel_type` recursively:
#
# 1. It first samples a parent kernel type using our `choose_kernel_type` distribution.
# 2. If the kernel is `Plus` or `Times`, it recursively calls itself to generate two sub-kernels
#    (called `:left` and `:right`), and returns the composite kernel.
# 3. If the kernel is a primitive, then it samples the parameters from `uniform(0, 1)` distributions.
#    (Note that `Periodic` kernels have two parameters, unlike the others, so we handle it specially.)

# Prior on kernels
@gen function covariance_prior()
    # Choose a type of kernel
    kernel_type ~ choose_kernel_type()

    # If this is a composite node, recursively generate subtrees
    if in(kernel_type, [Plus, Times])
        return kernel_type({:left} ~ covariance_prior(), {:right} ~ covariance_prior())
    end
    
    # Otherwise, generate parameters for the primitive kernel.
    kernel_args = (kernel_type == Periodic) ? [{:scale} ~ uniform(0, 1), {:period} ~ uniform(0, 1)] : [{:param} ~ uniform(0, 1)]
    return kernel_type(kernel_args...)
end;

# Let's look at some sampled kernel programs from the model:

for i=1:10
    println(covariance_prior())
end

# We see that there's a bias towards shorter programs. (Do you see why this is?) But we also see that longer programs are possible, including programs that include multiple `Times` or `Plus` nodes.

# ### Adding a likelihood to obtain a complete model

# We now connect the kernel program to the observed data, by using it to compute
# a covariance matrix and sampling from a multivariate normal distribution.

# +
@dist gamma_bounded_below(shape, scale, bound) = gamma(shape, scale) + bound

# Full model
@gen function model(xs::Vector{Float64})
    
    # Generate a covariance kernel
    covariance_fn = {:tree} ~ covariance_prior()
    
    # Sample a global noise level
    noise ~ gamma_bounded_below(1, 1, 0.01)
    
    # Compute the covariance between every pair (xs[i], xs[j])
    cov_matrix = compute_cov_matrix_vectorized(covariance_fn, noise, xs)
    
    # Sample from the GP using a multivariate normal distribution with
    # the kernel-derived covariance matrix.
    ys ~ mvnormal(zeros(length(xs)), cov_matrix)
    
    # Return the covariance function, for easy printing.
    return covariance_fn
end;
# -

# Let's visualize a collection of traces from the model:

function visualize_gp_trace(tr, xmin, xmax; title="")
    curveXs = collect(Float64, range(xmin, length=100, stop=xmax))
    data_xs, = get_args(tr)
    data_ys = tr[:ys]
    curveYs = [predict_ys(get_retval(tr), 0.000001, data_xs, data_ys, curveXs) for i=1:50]
    fig = plot()
    for (i, curveYSet) in enumerate(curveYs)
        plot!(curveXs, curveYSet, title=title, xlims=(xmin, xmax), 
            label=nothing, color="lightgreen")
    end
    scatter!(data_xs, data_ys, color="black", label=nothing)
end;

traces = [first(generate(model, (collect(Float64, -1:0.1:1),))) for i in 1:12]
plot([visualize_gp_trace(t, -1, 1) for t in traces]...)

# As we can see, many different patterns can be expressed in the kernel language we developed.
# Depending on the noise level, these patterns (green) may be more or less evident in the
# generated dataset (gray).

# ## 5. A tree regeneration proposal <a name="tree-regen" />

# We will use MCMC to find good covariance functions given a dataset.
#
# First, we write a helper to generate an initial trace for a set of `xs`
# and `ys`:

function initialize_trace(xs::Vector{Float64}, ys::Vector{Float64})
    tr, = generate(model, (xs,), choicemap(:ys => ys))
    return tr
end;

# Next, we write a helper generative function that randomly chooses a node
# in a kernel program's syntax tree. It starts at the root, and flips a coin
# (at the address `:stop`) to decide whether to stop at the current node, 
# or to descend further down the tree. (If it reaches a leaf node, it's done,
# and `:stop` is `true` with 100% probability. Otherwise, the coin is fair.)
#
# The generative function _returns_ a hierarchical address specifying where the
# chosen node was sampled in the trace of the model. (This is for convenience later on.)

@gen function random_node_path(n::Kernel)
    if ({:stop} ~ bernoulli(isa(n, PrimitiveKernel) ? 1.0 : 0.5))
        return :tree
    else
        (next_node, direction) = ({:left} ~ bernoulli(0.5)) ? (n.left, :left) : (n.right, :right)
        rest_of_path ~ random_node_path(next_node)
        
        if isa(rest_of_path, Pair)
            return :tree => direction => rest_of_path[2]
        else
            return :tree => direction
        end
        
    end
end;

# To understand how this works, let's generate a sample model trace.
# (To make things interesting, we'll generate one where the first 
# kernel node is guaranteed to be `Plus`.)

example_model_trace, = generate(model, ([0.],), choicemap((:tree => :kernel_type) => Plus));
display(get_choices(example_model_trace))

# The returned covariance kernel program is:

example_covariance_kernel = get_retval(example_model_trace)

# Now, we can run our random node chooser:

random_node_chooser_trace = simulate(random_node_path, (example_covariance_kernel,));

# Its return value is a path to a node in our model:

get_retval(random_node_chooser_trace)

# Its trace shows _how_ it arrived at this path.

display(get_choices(random_node_chooser_trace))

# Feel free to run the cells above a few times to get a hang for what's going on.

# ### An involution proposal for tree regeneration

# We will use `random_node_path` to implement a _random subtree regeneration_ proposal.
#
# It will:
# * Choose a node using `random_node_path`.
# * Generate a brand new tree, using `covariance_prior()`, to replace the subtree at the chosen node.
#
# We begin by writing the "proposal randomness" function:

@gen function regen_random_subtree_randomness(prev_trace)
    path ~ random_node_path(get_retval(prev_trace))
    new_subtree ~ covariance_prior()
    return path
end;

# And now we write the involution. Recall that the third argument
# that the involution accepts is the _proposal return value_, in our
# case, a model address (like `:tree => :left`) corresponding to where
# a particular node and its children (i.e., a subtree) were generated
# in the model trace.

function subtree_involution(trace, forward_choices, path_to_subtree, proposal_args)
    # Need to return a new trace, backward_choices, and a weight.
    backward_choices = choicemap()
    
    # In the backward direction, the `random_node_path` function should
    # make all the same choices, so that the same exact node is reached
    # for resimulation.
    set_submap!(backward_choices, :path, get_submap(forward_choices, :path))
    
    # But in the backward direction, the `:new_subtree` generation should
    # produce the *existing* subtree.
    set_submap!(backward_choices, :new_subtree, get_submap(get_choices(trace), path_to_subtree))
    
    # The new trace should be just like the old one, but we are updating everything
    # about the new subtree.
    new_trace_choices = choicemap()
    set_submap!(new_trace_choices, path_to_subtree, get_submap(forward_choices, :new_subtree))
    
    # Run update and get the new weight.
    new_trace, weight, = update(trace, get_args(trace), (UnknownChange(),), new_trace_choices)
    (new_trace, backward_choices, weight)
